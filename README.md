# Star Wars Genesis Full Modlist
### This is an _attempt_ to list all mods in Star Wars Genesis. There will probably be some stuff I leave out by accident, especially in the Integrated Section. As of V5, we are currently sitting at around 240 mods.

##### Note: I will NOT be managing multiple versions of this page. You may see mods here that are in future versions.
##### Note: I Will NOT be providing version numbers of each and every mod. This is meant to be an overview of the modlist and not a way to manually install it.
